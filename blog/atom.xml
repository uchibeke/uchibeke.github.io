        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is my story of how I visited London with only $100 and without a visa. I
have dreamt of visiting London since I was a little boy. One morning, when I was
10 years old, I woke up to get ready for school and I told my mum about the
dream I had the night before. I was so excited because the dream was very
elaborate. It was a dream of me in London.</p>
<p>My 10-year old mind left no stone unturned in imagining me in London. It was not
just a trip around London in the hop-on-hop-off tour buses. Thinking back, the
dream must have been influenced by the movies I watched around the time. In it,
I wore an oversized warm black jacket with black leather gloves and a hat (I
can’t remember the color or style anymore lol). No detail was spared as I also
dreamed of the food that I ate and saw myself on top of the London Eye.</p>
<p>It was the start of a good day for a 10-year old.</p>
<p>Many years after that, in February 2019, I got to visit London by myself during
my 10-hour layover in Heathrow. I did this with my Nigerian passport without a
Visa and with less than $100. If you’ve been looking to visit London but have no
time, like me or are on a tight budget, like me, this post is for you.</p>

than $3 (650 NGN). She started by learning how to sew and then worked as a
tailor for a few years. After that, she expanded her small tailoring business
and started selling Fabrics. She went further to establish a fashion
apprenticeship centre to train other women to become fashion designers. From $3,
she grew her Business to multiple states in Nigeria, exported her designs to
people in Europe and North America and trained and funded more than 100 women.
She worked very hard and inspired my interest in the fashion and entertainment

<p>Most young Nigerian adults in this generation must be aware of the popular term
‘Yoruba Demon’; coined to ostensibly discredit but however celebrates the young,
charismatic, well-off men from the South-Western part of Nigeria who have made
it their pre-occupations to break the hearts of young ladies, thereby
facilitating sad love stories, irresistible gossip and blog/thread content.</p>

with a full scholarship from the Nigerian Government. I got this scholarship
after failing 3 times, rewriting the exam 3 times and interviewing 3 times. I
wait for 3 years. I persisted because I knew that I needed a more practical
education and that the Canadian experience will provide opportunities that will
enable me to have a wider impact.</p>
<hr>
<p>This week, I ceremonially graduated from the UofS as the first kid in my family
with an overseas degree. This is a happy yet solemn occasion for me and family.
My Canadian experience hasn’t only given more multiple options but it has also
opened my eyes to the things that I can accomplish. It has made me see the
options that I have. More importantly, It has allowed me to grow as a person and
taught about different cultures and people.</p>

that is inherently present in me. This is especially difficult because most
things that I see on social media and the news are stories of people like me
experiencing biased treatments — stories of unfair treatment due to skin colour.
Additionally, it’s hard to admit that I am biased because I have also
experienced bias myself and admitting that I am also biased is clouded by the
few negative experiences I have had with a few bad apples.</p>

benefits of the blockchain is that it will allow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbanked">unbanked
</a>get access to services that are
currently not accessible to them. The assumption is that a big challenge that
the unbanked face is a lack identification. And that because they have no
government-issued ID, this makes them unqualified for banking services since
banks cannot perform the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer">Know Your Customer
(KYC)</a> and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aml.asp">Anti-Money Laundry

customers. The belief is that *unbankedness *is mostly an identification
problem. This is true in some cases. I, however, believe that *unbankedness *is
not just an identification issue but an access-to-technology issue, also.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We wanted to understand the Nigerian Wedding Industry and people’s experience so
we did a huge survey. Ultimately, we wanted the survey to inform our decision as
to develop a platform for making the stressful process of wedding planning
fulfilling.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>February 13th, 2017 was the day. I woke up at midnight and felt the urge to
write something. My heart was filled with expressions that had to get out. It
felt like the expressions were going to cause an explosion if I did not let them
out.</p>

<p>So I let the bubbles them out. I picked up my journal and in the 10 minutes that
followed, I wrote down the first version of the poem you see below. Enjoy.</p>

take ages and if you’re a small designer, it’s easier to let it go. That must
stop!</p>
<p>This article is the second article in a series of developing a Blockchain
business network. Last week’s article focused on introducing this series and
highlighting its key features. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/developing-great-solution-blockchain-intro-uchi-nick-uchibeke?lipi=urn:li:page:d_flagship3_profile_view_base_post_details;Cgcl7gWISqixiBopEE6lKQ==">Check out the article to learn
more</a>.
This week, I will be highlighting some use cases of Blockchain. I will conclude
by sharing a use case that will be designed throughout this series.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Blockchain is not just Crypto. Blockchain can be used for many applications and
it is very easy to get started.</p>
<p>This is the first article in a series of short articles in which I will discuss
the process of designing a Blockchain business network using <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric">Hyperledger
Fabric</a>
(<a href="https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/">Composer</a>, specifically). The purpose
of this week’s piece is to set the tone for upcoming articles that I will
release weekly on Wednesdays.</p>
<hr>
<p>To begin, I will like to stress that my goal is to make this series very short
and non-technical. This means that no code will be shown and small details about
Blockchain will be absent allowing me to focus on the goal of the article which
is to design a simple business network with Hyperledger Fabric. Please, I urge
you to leave questions and comments in the comment section.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A year ago, I started long Internship. May 5th was the date; my first day at IBM
as a Software Developer Intern in the Performance Quality Assurance Team of the
Watson Data Platform organization. Excitement, bewilderment and nervousness.
These were not astray from my path: they stayed closely on my way. Prior to the
day, I’ve driven more than 3,000 km from Saskatoon to Toronto, had arguments
along the way, and rented a place.</p>
