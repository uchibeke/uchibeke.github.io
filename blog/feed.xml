            <description><![CDATA[<p>It’s an amazing feeling to watch your friend or relative get married. It’s even
more amazing to watch them start a family and home. Therefore, I’d expect you
would want to be as supportive as possible as you watch them do this. Where am I
headed? I’ll tell you. Giving wedding gifts is a significant wedding custom that
probably dates as far back as when people started celebrating weddings publicly
or beyond.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>When I was a kid growing up in Nigeria, my mother started a Business with less
than $3 (650 NGN). She started by learning how to sew and then worked as a
tailor for a few years. After that, she expanded her small tailoring business
and started selling Fabrics. She went further to establish a fashion
apprenticeship centre to train other women to become fashion designers. From $3,
she grew her Business to multiple states in Nigeria, exported her designs to
people in Europe and North America and trained and funded more than 100 women.
She worked very hard and inspired my interest in the fashion and entertainment
industry.</p>

<p>Most young Nigerian adults in this generation must be aware of the popular term
‘Yoruba Demon’; coined to ostensibly discredit but however celebrates the young,
charismatic, well-off men from the South-Western part of Nigeria who have made
it their pre-occupations to break the hearts of young ladies, thereby
facilitating sad love stories, irresistible gossip and blog/thread content.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>In the summer of 2013, I moved to Canada to start a BA&amp;BSc (combined) degree
with a full scholarship from the Nigerian Government. I got this scholarship
after failing 3 times, rewriting the exam 3 times and interviewing 3 times. I
wait for 3 years. I persisted because I knew that I needed a more practical
education and that the Canadian experience will provide opportunities that will
enable me to have a wider impact.</p>
<hr>
<p>This week, I ceremonially graduated from the UofS as the first kid in my family
with an overseas degree. This is a happy yet solemn occasion for me and family.
My Canadian experience hasn’t only given more multiple options but it has also
opened my eyes to the things that I can accomplish. It has made me see the
options that I have. More importantly, It has allowed me to grow as a person and
taught about different cultures and people.</p>

can we ensure that smokers and non-smokers are safe and public safety is not

compromising public safety?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>As a black male living in North America, it is sometimes hard to admit the bias
that is inherently present in me. This is especially difficult because most
things that I see on social media and the news are stories of people like me
experiencing biased treatments — stories of unfair treatment due to skin colour.
Additionally, it’s hard to admit that I am biased because I have also
experienced bias myself and admitting that I am also biased is clouded by the
few negative experiences I have had with a few bad apples.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I found the talk to be very interesting because Rebecca did not only focus on
Racial and Gender Bias.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At <a href="https://collisionconf.com/">Collision Conference</a> in New Orleans, I had the
privilege of listening to the talk <em>Diversity, coding &amp; bias in AI</em> by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebecca-parsons-871491/">Rebecca
Parsons</a> of
<a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a>. The talk shed light on some the
biases that exist in our society today.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>I was asked to speak to undergraduate students about how to get a great career
in tech. Below are some highlights from what I shared with them.</strong></p>
<p>I started by sharing a story about how passion augmented with extra-hard work
can help a person build an empire. The point of the story was that if you want
to stand out, you must not do the standard. You must not do what everyone else
is doing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To stand out, you must not do the standard</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I went on to encourage them to find their passion, <em>develop</em> a process and
create their own footsteps. I stressed the need of finding something they’re
good at and trusting their process (<a href="https://www.jeezyshop.com/collections/trust-ya-process">trust ya

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Many proponents of blockchain technology emphasize that one of the potential
benefits of the blockchain is that it will allow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbanked">unbanked
</a>get access to services that are
currently not accessible to them. The assumption is that a big challenge that
the unbanked face is a lack identification. And that because they have no
government-issued ID, this makes them unqualified for banking services since
banks cannot perform the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer">Know Your Customer
(KYC)</a> and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aml.asp">Anti-Money Laundry
(AML)</a> process on these unbanked
customers. The belief is that *unbankedness *is mostly an identification
problem. This is true in some cases. I, however, believe that *unbankedness *is
not just an identification issue but an access-to-technology issue, also.</p>

Nigerians love to party &amp; have fun. The wedding industry in one of the fastest
growing industries in Nigeria. In a typical Nigerian wedding, people can attend
without an invite and it is often hard to manage attendees. Additionally,
inviting and tracking guests can be a challenge because most invitations are

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Blockchain is not just Crypto. Blockchain can be used for many applications and
it is very easy to get started.</p>
<p>This is the first article in a series of short articles in which I will discuss
the process of designing a Blockchain business network using <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric">Hyperledger
Fabric</a>
(<a href="https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/">Composer</a>, specifically). The purpose
of this week’s piece is to set the tone for upcoming articles that I will
release weekly on Wednesdays.</p>
<hr>
<p>To begin, I will like to stress that my goal is to make this series very short
and non-technical. This means that no code will be shown and small details about
Blockchain will be absent allowing me to focus on the goal of the article which
is to design a simple business network with Hyperledger Fabric. Please, I urge
you to leave questions and comments in the comment section.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>A year ago, I started long Internship. May 5th was the date; my first day at IBM
as a Software Developer Intern in the Performance Quality Assurance Team of the
Watson Data Platform organization. Excitement, bewilderment and nervousness.
These were not astray from my path: they stayed closely on my way. Prior to the
day, I’ve driven more than 3,000 km from Saskatoon to Toronto, had arguments
along the way, and rented a place.</p>
