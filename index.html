											Tranxi makes people makers of languages. In just a few short steps, users are
											able to define a language by mapping each of the English alphabets to any character
											or collection of character. The person then types anything they want to translate and
											it gets translated to the langauge they just created.
										</p>
										<p>
											Imagine what people can do with an app like this integrated to a service like Facebook,
											the Facebook messenger app or Watsapp.
										</p>
										<p>
											Download Tranxi from <b><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.uchibeke.tranxi"
											target="_blank">Google Play Store </a></b>
											or see it in action at <b><a href="http://tranxi.uchibeke.com/"
											target="_blank">tranxi.uchibeke.com</a>.</b>
										</p>
										<p>
											Tranxi or UTranslate is inspired by <a>Jungle Language</a>,
											a language we often resorted to as high school kids in Port harcourt,
											to conceal what we are talking about. I had to buy lunch for one of my classmates,
											<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/divine-onwumere-7a814180" target="_blank">Divine</a>,
											to learn the language. I did not, however, realize how easy the language was.
										</p>
										<p>
											Basically, in Jungle language, the vowels are changed to numbers-  a = 1, e = 2,
											i = 3, o = 4, and u = 5. Each of the consonants, on the other hand, remain as is,
											however, an 'a' is appended to them - B becomes Ba, C becomes Ca, D becomes Da,
											F becomes Fa ... and Z becomes Za.
										</p>
										<p>
											In Jungle Language, if I wanted to write
											<br />
											<b>How &nbsp are &nbsp You?</b>,
											<br />
											I would say
											<br />
											<b>Ha4Wa &nbsp 1Ra2 &nbsp Ya45?</b>
										</p>
										<p>
											In jungle language, we also say out each alpabet when speaking, so;
											<br />
											<b>How &nbsp are &nbsp You?</b>,
											<br />
											would be said as
											<br />
											<b>Ha-4-Wa  &nbsp1-Ra-2 &nbsp Ya-4-5?</b>, pronoucing each consonant and vowel.
											&nbsp  (◕‿◕) .
										</p>
										<p>
											Tranxi's default language is Jungle language. However, with Tranxi, you can also create
											you own language just like Jungle language. Just add what you want each of the alphabets
											to be, start typing  and whatever you type gets translated. Copy and send via email.
											Click the share button to share using most mediums. I am yet to implement the share
											button. &nbsp ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ .

										<div class="container-fluid">
											<div class="row">
												<p>
													<strong>Problem: </strong>
												</p>
												<p>
													How do I translate back to English after a text has been transalated to a
													language I created in Tranxi. Let's imagine my friend and I have set up the
													same custom language in our Tranxi App, and she sends me some text/email she
													translated from English to our language using Tranxi. You would think it would
													be nice and easy to just copy the text to Tranxi and translate it back to
													English, right? I think so too, maybe not easy.
												</p>
												<p>
													However, since the language is a custom language and Tranxi allows the use
													of an infinite amount of combination of characters, words or even blocks of
													texts (think paragraphs ಠ_ಠ) for the representation of an English character
													while creating a language, how do we convert, say, a simple paragraph translated
													from English to a custom language in Tranxi back to readable English. How do
													we implement a System to do that?
												</p>
												<p>
													For one thing, a word in English or Custom language contains no recognizable
													delimiter. Also a word comprised of a character or characters which could now
													have been represented with any possible combination of characters, words or
													even a paragraph or paragraphs. How do we implement Tranxi to be smart enough
													to use the language we defined to convert from the custom language back to
													English? While these challenges remain unsummounted, Tranxi, currently, is:
												</p>
												<ol>
													<li>
														A hybrid App allowing users to map English alphabets to one or more
														letters/numbers/symbols of any existing language supported on the
														user’s device.
													</li>
													<li>
														Translates user input to the defined ‘language’ in real time.
													</li>
													<li>
														Inspired by my high school experience learning “jungle language” in Nigeria.
													</li>
													<li>
														Initiated, Designed and implemented.
													</li>
												</ol>
												<p>
													I would like to console myself with the thought that since one purpose of the App
													is to allow only people who know the code to understand the text/email they
													receive, they would have to know the code by heart, however, it would be nice
													to be able to tranlate back from a custom language to English.
												</p>
												<p>
													<strong>Strategy: </strong>
												</p>
												<p>
													Designed an algorithm that takes user input (string), inserts it to a dynamic
													keyed dictionary, compares each element to a second dictonary using the key
													and then converts to a specified langauge. This is just an abstraction of
													what happens. There is more to it. However, the algorithm is efficient
													and translation happens instantly as the user types.

								</div>
								<div class="modal-body container-fluid">
									<div class=" container-fluid">
										<br>
										<p>
											When we go to the gym, our main goal is to workout. We do not want to waste
											between 10-15 minutes trying to complete a Gym waiver form like I did. This is a
											solution to the long wait time I experienced when I went to the gym in September 2015.
										</p>
										<p>
											<strong>Problem: </strong>
										</p>
										<ol>
											<li>
												Today, I experienced something strange when I went to the on-campus gym to
												do my regular workout. I was surprised when everyone that came in was asked to
												sign a Liability Waiver form on paper. That was strange because we have never
												had to sign a waiver for the 2.5 years I have been in the U of S.
											</li>

											<li>
												I think that signing those forms is a necessary evil because I believe that
												the University and the gym should be protected  in case any accident occurred.
												However, I see a few issues with signing those forms the way we did.
											</li>
											<li>
												Signing the forms was consuming. It took between 5-10 minutes.
											</li>
											<li>
												Keeping a record of each person that signed the form and storing and retrieving
												the the record for each person when its needed will almost be impossible since
												it’s on paper
											</li>
											<li>
												The process is expensive to the University because of the Paper, the toner and
												also wage for the additional Student assistant who assisted with the process.
											</li>
											<li>
												Lastly but definitely not the least. The process is not friendly to the environment
												because of the paper, the toner and the pen ink that is used.

													Initial font size was really small. The earlier transitions I had were

													do a usability study to determine things that need to be changed, removed or

												<strong>Research: </strong>
											</p>
											<p>
												I observed users waiting in line to complete the paper liability waiver.
												As one of those who waited to complete the waiver, I felt frustrated for the
												long time I had to wait. I also did not like the fact that I did not know the
												reason why I was completing said waiver. I did not know that I was going to complete
												a waiver until it was my turn to do it. That was after a 5 minutes wait.
												Furthermore,  I imagine that it must have been more stressful for the attendant
												who had to explain to each member what the forms where. Also the attendant had to
												stop some members were walking into the gym because did not know what the line
												was for. With the process I designed, signing the waiver will be fast, efficient
												and easy for members and staff.
											</p>

											<p >
												<strong>Process:</strong>
											</p>
											<p >
												I started with a very rough and dirty sketch of what I I thought would solve the
												problem I experienced and make users and staff  happy. I made changes to initial
												sketch and iterated through several sketches. This was easy to do because I was
												doing the sketch on a whiteboard.
											</p>
											<p>
												After I was satisfied with the rough sketch I had in my whiteboard, I recreated
												the sketch in JUSTINMIND Prototyper. I started with a basic JUSTINMIND Prototyper
												website layout and then designed from there. One thing I experienced while doing
												the prototype in JUSTINMIND was that more ideas came to mind and I implemented them.

												<strong>Research: </strong>
											</p>
											<p>
												A User in the wiki page I was part of was wondering why links open in the same tab
												and takes her away from the wiki. Initially, I thought the one who added the content
												did not enable links to open in new tab.
											</p>
											<p>
												To test my hypothesis, I tried to add a new link to the wiki. I was surprised to
												learn that there is no option that allows links to open in a new tab. The default
												and only option was for links to open on the same tab.
											</p>
											<p>
												After further research, I learned that to change the way links are opened, the
												system administrator had to edit the code of the actual wiki software. The issue
												with this is that most regular users that add content to the wiki are not
												programmers and do not know much about html. css or javascript. Also, the
												administrators of the wiki may not want to mess with the code of the wiki since
												it was not developed by them.
											</p>

											<p >
												<strong>Prototyping and Design:</strong>
											</p>
											<p >
												Building on the already existing screen, I imported a screenshot of the “Add link”
												page to axure and added some check boxes. By doing this simple change, users have
												to ability to decide how they want to use the wiki.
