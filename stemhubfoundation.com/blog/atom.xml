        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have dreamt of my wedding since I was a little boy. One morning, when I was 4
years old, I woke up to get ready for school and I told my mum about the dream I
had the night before. I was so excited because the dream was very elaborate. It
was a dream of my wedding.</p>
<p>My 4-year old mind left no stone unturned in imagining the grandest of weddings.
It was not a traditional wedding and thinking back, it must have been influenced
by the movies I watched around the time. I wore a black tuxedo with a pristine
white shirt and a tie (I can’t remember the colour or style anymore lol). No
detail was spared as I also dreamed of the music that was played as my bride
walked down the aisle to me.</p>

<p>Most young Nigerian adults in this generation must be aware of the popular term
‘Yoruba Demon’; coined to ostensibly discredit but however celebrates the young,
charismatic, well-off men from the South-Western part of Nigeria who have made
it their pre-occupations to break the hearts of young ladies, thereby
facilitating sad love stories, irresistible gossip and blog/thread content.</p>

<p>With planning a Nigerian wedding or any wedding at all, there’ll always be more
things to do even when you think you have done the most. Planning a wedding
involves putting so many ideas together. These ideas entail: a venue, event
planner, caterer, DJ, photographer and so on. The individuals or groups that
provide these services are what most people refer to as vendors. Well,
specifically, wedding vendors.</p>

Nigerians love to party &amp; have fun. The wedding industry in one of the fastest
growing industries in Nigeria. In a typical Nigerian wedding, people can attend
without an invite and it is often hard to manage attendees. Additionally,
inviting and tracking guests can be a challenge because most invitations are
delivered, by hand, by the couple or their family members. An
