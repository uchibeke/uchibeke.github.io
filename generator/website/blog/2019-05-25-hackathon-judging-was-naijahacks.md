For a Hackathon, the selection process should be free, fair, and transparent.
Everyone should have a fair chance to pitch and be heard. Additionally, the
details and reasons for the winnings should be shared with all participants.
Sadly, for NaijaHacks 2018, we were not clear or open enough about the Judging
process and winning criteria. We did not communicate exactly how the teams were
selected and we failed to livestream the results or highlight the criteria to
participants in realtime on demo day. For this, we take responsibility and we
will better for NaijaHacks 2019.

Because the process was not shared with everyone on demo day or after then, we
hope that this post will address how we selected the winners and address some
concerns that we all have.

### NaijaHacks Hackathon Judging Process

Firstly, the selection of top winners and top 5 teams was based entirely on the
feedback from judges both onsite and remote. Teams were judged by pairwise
comparison. For example, for each team a Judge sees, the app asks them to pick
between the current team and the previous team. They pick the better team based
on the judging[ criteria](https://naijahacks2018.devpost.com/) we set and shared
with them. The judging app, Gavel developed at MIT, then does the magic of
ranking the teams based on feedback. Additionally, teams are assigned to judges
by the app in a way that ensures that all teams get a fair chance and are heard.
[Anish

one of the developers of the judging app shared detail about the judging
algorithm and app. Please, [check it
out](https://www.anishathalye.com/2015/03/07/designing-a-better-judging-system/).

The winner of each category was the top team from that category. Additionally,
audience votes or votes from [DevPost](https://naijahacks2018.devpost.com/) were
not used in the selection process.

### NaijaHacks Hackathon results

Without further ado, we are super excited to release the official standing of
the top teams from NaijaHacks 2018.

and the NaijaHacks Community (20 elected participants from NaijaHacks 2018) are
working hard to get things ready for 2019. In keeping with the feedback we
received, for 2019, we will underpromise to hopefully, over deliver.
