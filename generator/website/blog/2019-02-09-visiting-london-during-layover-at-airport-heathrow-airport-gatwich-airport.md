This is my story of how I visited London with only \$100 and without a visa. I
have dreamt of visiting London since I was a little boy. One morning, when I was
10 years old, I woke up to get ready for school and I told my mum about the
dream I had the night before. I was so excited because the dream was very
elaborate. It was a dream of me in London.

My 10-year old mind left no stone unturned in imagining me in London. It was not
just a trip around London in the hop-on-hop-off tour buses. Thinking back, the
dream must have been influenced by the movies I watched around the time. In it,
I wore an oversized warm black jacket with black leather gloves and a hat (I
can’t remember the color or style anymore lol). No detail was spared as I also
dreamed of the food that I ate and saw myself on top of the London Eye.

It was the start of a good day for a 10-year old.

Many years after that, in February 2019, I got to visit London by myself during
my 10-hour layover in Heathrow. I did this with my Nigerian passport without a
Visa and with less than \$100. If you’ve been looking to visit London but have no
time, like me or are on a tight budget, like me, this post is for you.

### Entering the UK without Visa

Before I booked my flight, I did some research and I found that because I have a
Canadian visa and I am traveling to Canada, [I do not need a Visitor in transit
visa to do landside transit or transit between airports in the
UK](https://www.gov.uk/check-uk-visa/y/nigeria/transit/somewhere_else/yes).
Although all my flights were in Heathrow and I did not ordinarily have to go
throw customs, I had to since I wanted to visit London. For this, I technically
needed a tourist visa but because my layover was long and the border officer was
convinced that I will leave the UK, he stamped my passport and I was able to
leave the transit area and enter the UK with my Nigerian passport. Here’s how it
went down.

- **Officer:** Where are you traveling to?
- **Me:** Canada.
- **Officer:** What are you going to do there?
- **Me:** I work there.

`
Another officer comes to the desk. Scans my passport to check if it’s genuine.
I smile.
`

- **Officer:** So you checked your bags already and you don’t need to go through
  immigration since you leave from Heathrow?
- **Me:** Yes. I have a long 12hour layover and I was hoping to visit London.
- **Officer:** Ok. But you need to apply for a tourist visa to do that.
- **Me:** Yes. I was hoping that the Visitor in Transit visa will be sufficient to
  see London since I have a long layover.
- **Officer:** Yes and No. Since you are not transiting at another airport but
  visiting, it might not work that way. But, hmmm, the layover is long… Was that
  the only flight available when you were booking?
- **Me:** Yes.
- **Officer:** Ok. What do you do for work?
- **Me:** Software Engineer.
- **Officer:** How long have you lived in Canada?
- **Me:** Over 5 years.
- **Officer:** How long were you in Nigeria for?
- **Me:** Just a couple of days. 11 days.
- **Officer:** Have you been to the UK before?
- **Me:** No

`
Looks through my passport. Examines scans of multiple visits to the US, Canada,
Nigeria, and other countries. Realizes I have the larger 64-page passport as
opposed to the regular 32 pages one.
`

`Completes and signs my landing card, stamps passport and hands them to me.`

- **Officer:** So I am letting you enter the UK. Please, do not miss your flight
  to Canada.
- **Me:** Yes. Thanks, man. Have a good day.

All these happened in less than 5minutes. The questions were many but the
experience was positive because the officers were courteous and respectful. Will
totally recommend. Just be nice.

### Observation

The architecture in London is very impressive. Gold embellishments are very
common. And everyone was very nice. I was alone so I always asked people around
to take pictures of me and everyone obliged. I did not have google maps so asked
around and people took their time to help me figure out where I was and how I
would get to my next destination.

Everyone I talked to went above and beyond to help out. I will definitely want
to visit again.

### Uchi’s Recommendations

It is possible to tour London in less than 12-hour layover. I recommend you do
this only if you have a layover that is over 7 hours as you will spend about

- 3 hours on round trip travel between the city center and Heathrow,
- 2 hours for customs and security check, both ways
- 15–30 minutes to store and pick up your carry-on and
- 30 minutes just waiting around for your tour buses and figuring out what bus to
  board

With a 7 hour layover, you will only have about an hour to see London. With 10
hours or more, you have ample time to see multiple parts of the city.
