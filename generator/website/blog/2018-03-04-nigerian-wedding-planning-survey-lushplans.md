We wanted to understand the Nigerian Wedding Industry and people’s experience so
we did a huge survey. Ultimately, we wanted the survey to inform our decision as
to develop a platform for making the stressful process of wedding planning
fulfilling.

### The Wedding Survey Structure

After weeks of research and tweaking, we decided on a structure. The wedding
survey was structured into 3 sections:

* For people who have experience planning a wedding.
* For people who have assisted or played a part in someone’s wedding plan.
* For people who have never been involved in wedding planning.

Users get redirected to a page with tailor-made questions based on their
response to the question, “Have you ever planned a wedding?”

### Survey Goals

With the Wedding survey, we pursued 5 goals:

1.  To learn about how people will prefer to invite others to their wedding
1.  To learn how people find wedding vendors
1.  To understand the biggest challenges of planning a wedding
1.  To learn how different methods of invitation affect people’s attendance at the
wedding.
1.  To get the average time people need to make their wedding plans.

### Demographics Summary

* 83% were single
* 71% of the response was from people between the ages of 20 to 30 years.
* 66% have never planned a wedding
* 61% of respondents were males.
* 22% has planned a wedding, and
* 12% partially helped to plan a wedding.


### Survey Results

**How do people want to invite guests to their wedding?**

The results showed that people prefer to use printed Invitations over other
means of invitation. In fact, over 76% of the respondents said they will use
printed invitation. Some reasons why people chose printed invitation were
because it is more formal, traditional and classy. It is tangible, can be
flaunted, can be used as a keepsake. It also makes guests feel special.

**Will married people who used printed invitation use it again if they were to
redo their wedding?**

Surprisingly, no. Not all married people who used printed invitations will use
them again. For married respondents, the figure went down from over 91% to 66%.
What happened here is that they learned from the experience and decided that as
a replacement for invitation, they will email, SMS, social media apps, or apps.

**What other methods will people use to invite guests to their wedding?**

Although invitation by printed invites was a winner across the 3 groups of
participants, other methods followed closely. People are willing to invite
guests by texting them (SMS) or giving them a call. On average, more than 50% of
participants said they that will be happy to invite guests to their wedding by
either texting them or calling them.

With regards to how people like to invite guests, two additional figures caught
our attention:

1.  After Printed Invitation, SMS, Phone call, and a Social media direct message
(DM) were the next highest rated options.
1.  Most of the married couples who said they will no longer use printed invitations
opted to use sms and phone calls to invite guests to their wedding.

**How do people who are planning a wedding find wedding vendors?**

The most predominant method is by asking family members, friends, and/or
colleagues. People rarely went online to find vendors.

**What is the hardest part of planning a wedding?**

Across the board, Budget/financial constraints and logistics were highlighted to
be the major issues.

**Will guests be offended if you invite them with SMS, phone call, email or
social media DM?**

Around 90% of respondents will attend a wedding they were invited to via email
or SMS. 60% of respondents will definitely attend. This is also dependent on
whether the invitee is a friend, relative or acquaintance. 30% would not mind
attending despite being skeptical. 10% said they would not attend if they were
invited with these methods.

**BONUS: How many months do you need to plan a wedding?**

The 3 categories of participants were all asked how much time do you need to
plan a wedding? It’s kind of difficult to answer this question because the
response was almost evenly distributed between 0–3 months, 3–6 months and 6–12
months. Despite this, one thing we are certain of is that most people (More than
75%) believe that they need less than 1 year to plan their wedding. Narrowing
the analysis down shows that around 35%, the largest, of participants across all
groups, voted for 3–6 months. About 30% of married participants, however,
thought that they needed 0–3 months. This leads us to conclude that 5 months or
less is the time needed to plan a wedding. We believe that the sweet spot is
6months.

### Next Steps

We are planning to attend [Wed
Expo](https://www.bellanaija.com/2018/01/register-wed-expo/) on March 23rd-25th
and we are looking to connect with the organizers of the expo before the day to
see how we can share this survey with vendors.

If you see us at Wed Expo in Lagos and want to chat about the Survey Results or
[Lush Plans](https://lushplans.com/), please start a conversation. After the
expo, we will be sharing stories about vendors we meet and about our experience
at the Expo in a follow-up post.
