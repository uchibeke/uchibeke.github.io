NaijaHacks is the brainchild of [Uchi
Uchibeke](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickku/), a Nigerian-Canadian Engineer at
Shopify and Founder of Lush Plans, Africa’s leading event planning platform.
Uchi said “I started NaijaHacks because of the impact that participating in
Hackathons at Stanford, Harvard, Princeton, and Waterloo had on me as a student.
I want to use NaijaHacks to inspire a new generation of Nigerian innovators by
creating a Hackathon that is exciting to attend, welcomes first-timers and
enables them to compete globally”.

To date, more than 20 sponsors and partners from all around the world are
supporting NaijaHacks. Lush Plans, Ingressive, Eiinspire, the Ondo State
Government, .TECH, IvoryMark, STEMHub Foundation are providing funding to make
the 2018 event possible. Other sponsors are providing facilities, products,
prizes, staff and other items to support.

The 2018 NaijaHacks Hackathon will start online on October 18, 2018, with a
world-class team of mentors from UK, USA, Canada, Singapore, and Nigeria. During
the online part, participants join teams or are matched with others to build
solutions to a challenge they pick as a team. Following the online part, on
October 24, the top 100 teams are invited to demo to a team of Judges at Zone
Tech Park, Lagos using a process that has been tried and tested at Major League
Hacking (MLH) Hackathons across North America and Europe. The Hackathon
culminates in a Pitch and award ceremony where the best of the best teams pitch
to a panel of Judges from Silicon Valley and Entertainers and Tech leaders from
Africa at Ingressives’s Tech Meets Entertainment (TME) event. The top teams and
winners in our over 20 categories will be awarded their prizes, worth millions
of naira, at the end of the October 25 event.

Uchi Uchibeke said “NaijaHacks is not a Hackathon. It is a Movement of Makers.
Of Leaders. Of Disruptors. It is Nigeria’s Official Hackathon”. Interested
