February 13th, 2017 was the day. I woke up at midnight and felt the urge to
write something. My heart was filled with expressions that had to get out. It
felt like the expressions were going to cause an explosion if I did not let them
out.

So I let the bubbles them out. I picked up my journal and in the 10 minutes that
followed, I wrote down the first version of the poem you see below. Enjoy.

> **I got news for you**

> **It’s not that I love you.**

> **That’s not news to you,**

> **That’s sorta news, overdue**

~

> _Maybe the news is that I love your hue._

> _Maybe it’s the view of you._

> _The glue of me to you._

> _When we knew we were due_

> _We knew we won’t be subdued_

~

> _Do call me to hear the news_

> _Cos I can’t wait to hear from you_

> _To care for you_

> _Breakfast in bed for you_

> _Excitement in stock for you_

> _New things to try with you_

> _When I see you in 2_
