**I was asked to speak to undergraduate students about how to get a great career
in tech. Below are some highlights from what I shared with them.**

I started by sharing a story about how passion augmented with extra-hard work
can help a person build an empire. The point of the story was that if you want
to stand out, you must not do the standard. You must not do what everyone else
is doing.

> To stand out, you must not do the standard

I went on to encourage them to find their passion, _develop_ a process and
create their own footsteps. I stressed the need of finding something they’re
good at and trusting their process ([trust ya
process](https://www.jeezyshop.com/collections/trust-ya-process)).

I shared how accepting one opportunity opened many doors for me and the
challenges I faced before accepting the opportunity. The lesson from the story
was not to encourage them to be like me or break rules. I wanted to remind them
that it is worthwhile to do what they need to do to accelerate their career even
if it means annoying some people or breaking some rules. I added a caveat: when
breaking rules or annoying people, it is very important to keep in mind that
people that set and enforce the rules are humans and that if you are honest,
open and more importantly nice about the way you approach your rule breaking,
they will understand and support you if you get into trouble.

> some rules

### Two lessons from stories about success

1.  To stand out, we must not do the standard.
1.  Don’t be scared to go against the norm to move your career forward.

The last story I shared was about a young man that traveled to the US and won
many scholarships in the US but lost his student status because he got
distracted and decided to quit school. The lesson from that story was that we
should understand our situation, set priorities and goals based on our situation
and then stick to completing the goals that we set.

> Just like we have to get our hands dirty to enjoy chicken wings, we also need to
> get our hands dirty to be successful

I shared an Igbo language proverb that I really like. It is **Aka aja aja
n’ebute ọnụ mmanụ mmanụ **and it is translated **“Soiled hands brings forth oily
mouth”** but means that **Hard work precedes success and fun**. I explained that
just like we have to get our hands dirty to enjoy chicken wings, we also need to
get our hands dirty to be successful. I then shared what success means to me.
For me, deep down, success is the result of redoing things that I’ve previously
failed at.

### **Practical Tips and Tricks for a STEM Career**

1.  Join online communities of people in your major
    ([/r/cscareerquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/) for
    Computer Science)
1.  Get a mentor
1.  Expect and prepare for failure

If I were to start all over again and give myself advice:

**I will ignore generic resume templates** that are everywhere. I will instead
use google to find online communities of people in my field. Most fields have
those online forums for career advice and things like that. From this forum, I
will get a good resume template and tailor my resume to meet that standard.
Remember, think international! Don’t just think Saskatchewan or Canada. What
this does is that it sets you apart even if you decide to apply for jobs in
Saskatchewan. As an example, my resume is one page because that is the standard
for top tech companies. This has well for me as you might imagine. The truth,
however, is that it might not work for you so look online for what works for
your specific major.

> Mentorship is like being in a relationship. It should be mutual and symbiotic.

**Next, I will get a mentor again**: be curious, ask questions and be nice. I
believe that mentorship is like being in a relationship. It should be mutual and
symbiotic. So find someone that you can give something back to or someone that
will find satisfaction from knowing that they are mentoring you.

**So the third thing I will do if I was starting over again is that I will
expect and prepare for rejections.** Think of rejections as a learning
opportunity and delete the “we decided to move forward with a different
candidate” emails as soon as you get them. Then simply apply for more jobs with
your killer resume.

> True happiness does not come from our career accomplishments but from the people
> that love us and will be there for us when we can’t be there for ourselves

I concluded with something that I am really passionate about: A reminder to
enjoy life. This is because I believe that true happiness does not come from our
career accomplishments but from the people that love us and will be there for us
when we can’t be there for ourselves. I urged them to put an effort to build
relationships and spend time with people who truly care about.

> If you do not do the standard, do more than what’s required, go against the
> norm, be a misfit, annoy some people to propel your career and build meaningful
> relations, you will be closer to success than most people in the population.

### **Key points**

1.  To stand out, we must not do the standard.
1.  Don’t be scared to go against the norm to move your career forward.
1.  Build meaningful relations with mentors and people you love

### PS:

I am currently playing with the idea of a wedding Management App for Nigerian
Weddings because Nigerian weddings are huge and I think it will be cool to
understand the Nigerian wedding space since it’s growing explosively. Check out
