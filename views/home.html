					Farmers value direct feedback from their peers about a crop varieties that have been
					tried by their peers. The farmers we talked to value these feedbacks more than ratings in a
					Seed Guide published by a Corporation or by the Government. Onfarm is based on the feedback we
					got from farmers about the Sasktachewan Seed Guide.
