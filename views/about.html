        I have software development experience in some of the world's biggest companies like IBM, RBC Royal Bank of Canada, and Nutrien. 
         <br/>
        <br/>

        I have also helped companies develop Blockchain Proof of concepts and filed patents for some of them. One of the projects I worked at RBC Royal Bank is a Blockchain Client Identity management ecosystem that won 2 awards and won $25,000.

        Prior to that, I worked in the Watson Data Platform Organization at IBM, Toronto for 12 months where I redesigned & implemented a tool, Self Service Performance Quality Assurance (SSPQA), for optimizing the performance of dashDB and DB2 on a cluster of servers.
